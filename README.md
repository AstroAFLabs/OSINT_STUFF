# OSINT_STUFF
Bits and pieces for sifting signal from all the noise.

## This is the early iteration of what hopefully will be useful to some people. 

Thanks to Allcon Ltd for the inspiration to start this thing. Right now, there's no real structure in terms of folders etc.

I will put up python scripts etc as I come across or build them. Full disclosure: I am not really a coder, and ChatGPT helps a lot, but 

it's all about using the right tools properly, and this is a fantastic way to leverage AI. 
First item up, a small python script that uses the Gnews API to find ten headlines relating to whatever search terms you enter into a little 

search window. It's ugly and minimal, but it works. Play around with it, Feedback, comments, suggestions for features, feel free to give them!
